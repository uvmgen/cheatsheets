# Cheat sheets

[UVMGen](https://www.uvmgen.com) cheat sheets are available on GitHub to help facilitate contributions from the DV community.

To edit a cheat sheet:
1. Click on the **Edit** icon on the cheat sheet at www.uvmgen.com. This will take you to the cheat sheet on GitHub. Alternatively, click one of the \*.md files on [uvmgen/cheatsheets](https://github.com/uvmgen/cheatsheets).
2. Click the **Fork this project and edit the file** icon on the file page.
3. Make your edits using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
4. When you are happy with your changes scroll down to the **Propose file change** section, enter a title and description for your change. Click the **Propose file change** button.
5. Type a title and description for your pull request. Click the **Create pull request** button.

UVMGen will then gratefully review your contribution. If it is in line with the vision of UVMGen we'll make it a part of the UVMGen web site.

For more information on making a file edit see [this GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-another-users-repository).

### Example GitHub markdown

The GitHub markdown that we use on UVMGen looks something like this:

````markdown
## Start with h2 headings

Text in a cheat sheet can be written normally. Just hit Enter to add a new line.

To add in a code section use three backticks:

```systemverilog
class my_agent extends uvm_agent;

  // more code...

endclass
```

Use this syntax to [link to another cheat-sheet](api-master-sequences.md).
````

The above example markdown will be rendered on UVMGen like this:
